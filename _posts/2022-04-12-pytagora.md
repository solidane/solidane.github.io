[Pythagoras of Samos (570-495 BC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras) was a very influential ancient greek philosopher, whose work
contributed in many fields such as music, philosophy, astronomy and mathematics, the latter including the famous Pythagorean theorem.

The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental and certainly well-known geometric theorem. According to this theorem, if we are dealing with a right-angled triangle (with one of the angles being 90°), then the hypotenuse is equal to the square root of the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides.  


This theorem has a wide-set of application including engineering and construction fields, face recognition in security cameras, navigation etc...

**To be proven:** When a triangle has a right angle (90°) and squares are made on each of the three sides, then the biggest square has the exact same area as the other two squares put together!

### Let's visualize the statement above
So we draw a right-angled triangle and beside the sides of the triangle we pictured the representing squares, 
- A <math display="inline"><mn>3</mn><mo>&times;</mo><mn>3</mn></math> square for the height (side)
- A <math display="inline"><mn>4</mn><mo>&times;</mo><mn>4</mn></math> square for the width (side)
- A <math display="inline"><mn>5</mn><mo>&times;</mo><mn>5</mn></math> square for the hypotenuse

According to the theorem the sum of the squares of the side should equal the square of the hypotenuse.

##### Is that the case in our visualization?
Let's check it out, count the small squares of the sides, sum them up and compare if the sum of the sides equals the amount of squares of the hypotenuse.
You should be getting 9 + 16 = 25. 

### Try it yourself
Play around with <math display="inline"><mi>a</mi></math> and <math display="inline"><mi>b</mi></math> to see how and why this theory holds:
<div id="observablehq-21c7f424">
  <div class="observablehq-viewof-a"></div>
  <div class="observablehq-viewof-b"></div>
  <div class="observablehq-canvas"></div>
  <div class="observablehq-blla"></div>
</div>
<script type="module">
  import {Runtime, Inspector} from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js";
  import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/@864af2bf64442aa6/untitled.js?v=3";
  (new Runtime).module(define, name => {
    if (name === "viewof a") return Inspector.into("#observablehq-21c7f424 .observablehq-viewof-a")();
    if (name === "viewof b") return Inspector.into("#observablehq-21c7f424 .observablehq-viewof-b")();
    if (name === "canvas") return Inspector.into("#observablehq-21c7f424 .observablehq-canvas")();
    if (name === "blla") return Inspector.into("#observablehq-21c7f424 .observablehq-blla")();
  });
</script>

### The math behind it
The equation to express the theorem in a right-angled triangle is
<math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mrow>
    <msup>
      <mi>a</mi>
      <mn>2</mn>
    </msup>
    <mo>+</mo>
    <msup>
      <mi>b</mi>
      <mn>2</mn>
    </msup>
    <mo>=</mo>
    <msup>
      <mi>c</mi>
      <mn>2</mn>
    </msup>
  </mrow>
</math>

where <math display="inline"><mi>a</mi></math> and <math display="inline"><mi>b</mi></math> represent the cathetuses, otherwise known as the legs adjacent or opposite-sided of the right angle and <math display="inline"><mi>c</mi></math> is the hypotenuse.
