[Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855 AD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss) is acknowledged as one of the most influential mathematicians of all time. His contribution includes not 
only fields of mathematics, but physics and statistics as well. His strong mathematical intuition was to be noticed from an early age, where 
allegedly as a school boy at request of his teacher to sum up numbers from one to a hundred recognized a pattern. 
He had fifty pairs of numbers when he added the first and last number in the series, the second and second-last number in the series, and so on. 
For example: (1 + 100), (2 + 99), (3 + 98), ..., (50 + 51), and each pair has a sum of 101. So

## How to prove sum of naturals visually

Well let's imagine we want to know the sum of the first five natural numbers. That means we have to
add $$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5$$. Instead of writing out numbers, let's pretend we are construction workers, and we are building a pair of stairs of same coloured bricks. 
We want to layer 1 brick on top of, 2 bricks, 3 bricks… all the way down to 5 bricks. Something like this, so you get the idea:

Sure, we could go to 100 or 1000 bricks, but with 5 you get the idea. How do we count the number of the bricks needed to construct the stairs?
Of course, one could do it manually but why do that where there's another quicker way.
Let’s say we mirror our stairs  (using another colour to represent the mirrored bricks),

and then topple it over:

Now for the explanation: How many bricks do we have in total? Well that's just the area of the whole rectangle,
and it being the $$5 \times 6 = 30$$

We have $$n$$ rows and $$n + 1$$ columns, since every orange bricked is paired up with a white one.


But of course, we don’t want the total amount of bricks, we just want the number of orange bricks, which is nothing else but the half of the bricks in total, in our example $$30 \div 2 = 15$$.

That this theory holds can be visually proven with y-axis being of length $$n$$ and x-axis of length $$n+1$$. The amount of the black squares represents the sum of the first $$n$$ integers.


Use the slider below to test it for different values of $$n$$.

## The math behind it
Summarizing Gauss Summation symbolically leads to this formula:
$a^2$ $$a^2$$ /(a^2\) \\[a^2\\]
